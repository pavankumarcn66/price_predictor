# Product-Price-Prediction
This is an complete end-to-end project where I had fused 3 different rergression problems statements into one web-application. In this project we can predict the price of 3 main products which are Laptop, Mobile and Car. Each of the project has almost 90% accuracy. The data used in this project is collected from various sources such as kaggle, github and techniques used such as web-scraping.
